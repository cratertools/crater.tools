                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    These terms of service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of Codifier (&rdquo;the App&rdquo;), provided by its developer, Piotr Bakker (referred to as &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). By either purchasing, downloading, or using the App, you agree to these Terms.
                </p>
                <h4>Payment and Licensing</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    The App is provided for a one-time purchase with no recurring fees. This payment grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the App for personal purposes only. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your license if these Terms are violated.

                <h4>Your Data and Privacy</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to remote servers or third parties. All data generated through the App remains stored locally on your device. As we do not access this data, we are not responsible for its loss or unauthorized access.
                </p>
                <h4>No Warranties</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    The App is provided on an &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as-available&rdquo; basis. While we hope you enjoy using it, we cannot make guarantees about the App&rsquo;s performance, functionality, or its ability to meet any specific needs. We may release updates or improvements to the App, but we are under no obligation to do so at any time.
                </p>
                <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary">
                    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any damages arising from your use of the App. This includes, without limitation, any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or any issues such as data loss, device malfunction, or errors resulting from the App&rsquo;s use.
                </p>
                <h4>Refund Policy</h4>
                <p class="text-secondary">
